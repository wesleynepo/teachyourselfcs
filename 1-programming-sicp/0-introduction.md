### What?
I'm gonna take Brian Harvey's SICP lectures (61A course at Berkeley) and probably do the exercises from the first three chapters. 

### Why?
People often call me crazy, but I like to understand everything from scratch, I can't keep up using and doing something without understanding well, and I hope to learn more about cool stuff.


### Conclusion
Working progress!
